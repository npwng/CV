						<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
						<p>I'm a second year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Alberta. I have been interested in STEM most of my life. I have been tinkering with things for as long as I can remember. In elementary school, I had started modifying Nerf blasters. Within a few years, I had began soldering electronics including mini speakers and solar chargers. I had upgraded to adding LiPo batteries to my Nerf Blasters. In 8th grade, I got my first 3D printer. Over the next 4 years, I replaced all of the original brackets, replaced the x and y axes, upgraded the lead screw and motor position, and attempted to switch out the mainboard and stepper drivers.</p>

						<p>Joining the Engineering program at the University of Alberta has allowed me to expand my knowledge and understanding in various facets of the field. It has also allowed me to access the Elko Engineering Garage makerspace where I'm able to get hands on experience with bringing ideas into the real world. It has also helped me understand the different pros and cons as well as design liimtations and best practices for different manufacturing processes.I have been using their CO<sub>2</sub> and fiber laser cutters since my first semester at the U of A. I have since used them countless times for class, perosnal, and club projects. In addition to that, I have been trained on many of the (other equipment)[https://confluence.garage.ualberta.ca/category/eq] including PCB mill, soldering station, vinyl cutter, embroidery machine. I am currently being trained on the Tormach PCNC 770 and 1100. I am eager to get trained on their CNC metal lathe and waterjet cutter as soon as training is avaliable.</p>

						<p>Apart from engineering, I am an avid mountain biker</p>
